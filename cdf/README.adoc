=== What
Contains a collection of documents and links to run a CDF workshop.

=== Pre-Requisites (For Instructors)
. Login to AWS (Hortonworks or Cloudera) with your Okta username and password.
.. AMI, in EU-Frankfurt region with minifi and minifi-toolkit pre-installed `ami-046741d23e86f3cf9`

. Copy this AMI to your region. 

. If you want to start from fresh, the deploy script is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsellappa/workshop/master/cdf/deploy/deploy_cdf_33.sh[here].

. Create a new ssh key via ssh-keygen and import it into the required region.This key will be used for giving access to the AMI for participants.Save the private key. If you want to reuse the public https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vsellappa/e8e5f9e3bb0ed236693ac58c4345cb9d/raw/b2c0e88f59172cf26cbe136c5f83b9fffe047d8f/FRA_HDF_workshop.pem[key] from below. The private key is https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KxIs5smWz9SUthvqiifpO8RZMupU3bQM[here].

. Create the AMI instance in the normal way and attach the previously generated keypair. Ensure that the security group has 22,6667,7788,8080,9090,61080 accessible.

NOTE: Venues might have specific ports blocked, check this before-hand.

. Once the instance is up, login via ssh, login to Ambari and check NiFi

 ssh -i <.pem file> -l centos <IPAddress> 

. For Ambari:

 http://<IPAddress:8080> 
 username: admin
 password: StrongPassword


. Convert the .pem or openssh key to .ppk for windows users: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/convert-pem-file-into-ppk/[ConvertPEM]
.. Upload the .ppk file to a secure location. (I use private github).
.. This file needs to be handed to the participants.

. CDF 101 and 201 presentation deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bPtX2R1XVXgwV7zukJlgH4FZrV4zHGVQYijd5YrsWuI/edit?usp=sharing[Slidedeck]

=== TODO's

. Automate creation of "n" number of AWS instances via CLI based on an AMI-ID.
.. Re-map ports on the AMI ??
. Generate "n" ssh keys and attach to each one of the instance.
. Create a file that maps the IP Address of the newly created instances with their respective ssh keys.

=== For Participants

===== Connecting to Your Cluster

. Get the IPAddress of the EC2 node from your instructor.
