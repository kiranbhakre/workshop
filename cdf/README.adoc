.. AMI, in EU-Frankfurt region with minifi and minifi-toolkit pre-installed `ami-046741d23e86f3cf9`

. Copy this AMI to your region. 

. If you want to start from fresh, the deploy script is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsellappa/workshop/master/cdf/deploy/deploy_cdf_33.sh[here].

. Create a new ssh key via ssh-keygen and import it into the required region.This key will be used for giving access to the AMI for participants.Save the public key. If you want to reuse the https://github.com/vsellappa/workshop/tree/master/keys[key] combinations used here. The public key is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D6WKX5UzZrfBW1lW_Vjw7V6U3Az7kyiE?usp=sharing[here]. Attach the public key to your AMI instance. 

. Create the AMI instance in the normal way and attach the previously generated keypair. Ensure that 22,6667,7788,8080,9090,61080 ports are accessible.

NOTE: Venues might have specific ports blocked, check this before-hand. In some cases participant laptops might have restrictive firewalls as well.

. Once the instance is up, login via ssh, login to Ambari and check NiFi

 ssh -i <.pem file> -l centos <IPAddress> 

. For Ambari:

 http://<IPAddress:8080> 
 username: admin
 password: StrongPassword

. Convert the .pem or openssh key to .ppk for windows users: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/convert-pem-file-into-ppk/[ConvertPEM]
.. Upload the .ppk file to a secure location. (I use private github).
.. This file needs to be handed to the participants.
