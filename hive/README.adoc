NOTE: Venues might have specific ports blocked, check this before-hand. In some cases participant laptops might have restrictive firewalls as well.

. Once the instance is up, login via ssh, login to Ambari and check all services are green. Services are set to auto-start and might take upto 20 minutes to start.

 ssh -i <.pem file> -l centos <IPAddress> 

. For Ambari:

. Convert the .pem or openssh key to .ppk for windows users: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/convert-pem-file-into-ppk/[ConvertPEM]
.. Upload the .ppk file to a secure location. (I use private github).
